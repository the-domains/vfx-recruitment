  VFX Recruitment is a staffing solutions company specifically designed to
  assist VFX production studios with the challenges of talent acquisition. Job
  postings on employment websites limit the pool of candidates for any
  particular role to those that are actively looking for a position, who use
  employment websites as part of their job search. Within the VFX industry,
  jobseekers often avoid employment websites and move from each position to the
  next based on opportunities that they find through their network. VFX
  Recruitment helps companies take control of this process and ensure that the
  right candidates are introduced to companies at the right time. By actively
  seeking out top talent within the industry, VFX Recruitment casts the widest
  net possible and filters through the interested applicants for each position,
  based on specifications provided by the client. Leveraging recruitment
  experience and methodology, VFX Recruitment can help you build the teams you
  need for your productions.
