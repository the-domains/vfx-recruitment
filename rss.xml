            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>VFX Recruitment is a staffing solutions company specifically designed to assist VFX production studios with the challenges of talent acquisition. Job postings on employment websites limit the pool of candidates for any particular role to those that are actively looking for a position, who use employment websites as part of their job search. Within the VFX industry, jobseekers often avoid employment websites and move from each position to the next based on opportunities that they find through their network. VFX Recruitment helps companies take control of this process and ensure that the right candidates are introduced to companies at the right time. By actively seeking out top talent within the industry, VFX Recruitment casts the widest net possible and filters through the interested applicants for each position, based on specifications provided by the client. Leveraging recruitment experience and methodology, VFX Recruitment can help you build the teams you need for your productions.</strong></p>]]></description>
